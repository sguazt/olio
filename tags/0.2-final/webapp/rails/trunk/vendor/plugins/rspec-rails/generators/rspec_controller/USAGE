Description:
    The rspec_controller generator creates stub specs and files for a new
    controller and its views.

    The generator takes a controller name and a list of views as arguments.
    The controller name may be given in CamelCase or under_score and should
    not be suffixed with 'Controller'.  To create a controller within a
    module, specify the controller name as 'module/controller'.

    The generator creates stubs for a controller (and spec), a view (and spec)
    for each view in the argument list, plus a helper. 

Example:
    ./script/generate rspec_controller dog bark fetch
        ...
        create  spec/controllers/dog_controller_spec.rb
        create  app/controllers/dog_controller.rb
        create  app/helpers/dog_helper.rb
        create  spec/views/dog/bark_view_spec.rb
        create  app/views/dog/bark.rhtml
        create  spec/views/dog/fetch_view_spec.rb
        create  app/views/dog/fetch.rhtml

Modules Example:
    ./script/generate rspec_controller 'pets/dog' bark fetch
        ...
        create  spec/controllers/pets/dog_controller_spec.rb
        create  app/controllers/pets/dog_controller.rb
        create  app/helpers/pets/dog_helper.rb
        create  spec/views/pets/dog/bark_view_spec.rb
        create  app/views/pets/dog/bark.rhtml
        create  spec/views/pets/dog/fetch_view_spec.rb
        create  app/views/pets/dog/fetch.rhtml
