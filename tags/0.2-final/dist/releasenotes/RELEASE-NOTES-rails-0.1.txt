This is the first release of the rails implementation of Olio.
There are two tarballs for this release: 
apache-olio-rails-0.1.tar.gz is the binary kit.
apache-olio-rails-src-0.1.tar.gz is the source that corresponds to the binary kit.

Please use gtar to extract the contents as there are some very long filenames:
% gzcat apache-olio-rails-0.1.tar.gz | gtar -xvf - 

The instructions for setting up Olio from the binary kit are contained in 
rails_setup_kit.html which is located in the top-level directory.
You can also browse the document at 
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/olio/docs/rails_setup_kit.html

The instructions for setting up Olio from the source kit are contained in
rails_setup.html which is located in the 'docs' directory.

This release is known to work on ruby 1.8.6, ruby 1.8.7 and a
combination of rake 0.8.1/rails 2.1.2 or rake 0.8.4/rails 2.3.2.

Known Issues
=============
. Due to the way logging works in apache common HttpClient, you will see a
  lot of messages of the form "Redirect requested but followRedirects is disabled"
  in the faban run log. To turn off these annoying messages, add the following to
  ~faban/config/logging.properties:
	org.apache.commons.httpclient.level=SEVERE

. OLIO-76: Some times, the addition of an attendee fails resulting in the 
  following message in the run log:
     Add attendee failed, possible race condition
  
. OLIO-81: The cycle/think time requirements may fail for the AddPerson 
  and AddEvent operations. You can safely ignore this failure for now.
