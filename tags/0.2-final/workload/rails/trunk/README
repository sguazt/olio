This directory contains the source code for the Olio Rails workload
and data generators. The directory structure is standard to Faban.
The directories of interest (where source code resides) are bin, 
deploy and src. 

To build, create 'build.properties' from the corresponding template and
execute 'ant deploy.jar'. Once the faban master is started, you can
also automatically deploy the benchmark, by using 'ant deploy'.

An explanation of the directory structure follows:
- build.properties.template: This file is a template for build.properties
  that needs to exist in this directory before you can build and deploy
  the driver code.
  The faban.home property needs to be set to home directory where faban
  is installed. 
  The faban.url property needs to be set to the url of the faban master
  where the benchmark needs to be deployed.

- The bin directory contains workload specific scripts and executables.

- The deploy directory contains the run parameters (run.xml) and Xforms
  configuration (config.xhtml). 

- The src directory contains the source code for the driver, dbloader
  and fileloader. Corresponding shell-script wrappers reside in 'bin'.

- The resources directory contains static files used by the file loader.

- The config and lib directories hold standard faban content.

- The sbin directory contains utilities to run a benchmark outside
  the Faban harness. This will not be packaged into the deployment
  jar files. Benchmark-specific scripts and binaries should be places
  into the bin directory.
