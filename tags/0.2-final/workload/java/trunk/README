                    Java Olio Sample README

The  Java Olio sample provides an example for organizing a Faban
benchmark project as well as how to write a new benchmark. Many components
are generic to most Faban projects. It is a good starting point to copy the
directory from this sample to create your new benchmark. Many components
will work with no or little modifications.

Notes:
- The sbin directory contains utilities to run a benchmark outside
  the Faban harness. This will not be packaged into the deployment
  jar files. Benchmark-specific scripts and binaries should be places
  into the bin directory.
