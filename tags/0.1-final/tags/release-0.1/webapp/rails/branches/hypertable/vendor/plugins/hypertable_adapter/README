hypertable_adapter
==================

Hypertable Adapter allows ActiveRecord to communicate with Hypertable.

In ActiveRecord, each supported data store has an adapter that implements
functionality specific to that store as well as providing metadata for
data held within the store.  Features implemented by adapters typically
include:

  * connection handling
  * list of tables
  * list of columns per data
  * low-level support for qualified columns
  * statement execution (selects, writes, etc.)
  * latency measurement
  * fixture handling

The adapter provides low-level integration between Hypertable and
ActiveRecord.  A separate library called HyperRecord is required to fully 
integrate the two.

Basic Hypertable Adapter Configuration
======================================

Before using the adapter, you must declare a hypertable connection in
config/database.yml.  The adapter communicates with Hypertable using a
Thrift Broker (see http://hypertable.org/documentation.html for details)
which is part of the main Hypertable installation.  The connection record
in config/database.yml must identify the host name and the port used by
the Thrift Broker:

 hypertable:
   adapter: hypertable
   host: localhost
   port: 38080

Or, if you need to do it in code outside of database.yml:

 ActiveRecord::Base.configurations['hypertable'] = {
   'adapter' => 'hypertable',
   'host' => 'localhost',
   'port' => '38080'
 }
