Releases are built from this directory. 
Copy the build.properties.template to build.properties.
Ensure that the build.properties file has the correct <major>.<minor> numbers.
Set the property 'build.release' to 'true' if you're generating a release without a time-stamp.
Create release notes if required. Use the format RELEASE-NOTES-<type>-<version>.txt.
All release notes should reside in the 'releasenotes' directory.
To build all releases, simply type 'ant'.
The releases will be built in the 'nightly' directory.
DO NOT check in the 'nightly' directory into the repository.
However, it is appropriate to check-in new release notes added.
The build release should be uploaded to the apache distribution directory
after signing it.
