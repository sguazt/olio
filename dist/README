Releases are built from this directory. 
Copy the build.properties.template to build.properties.
Ensure that the build.properties file has the correct <major>.<minor> numbers.
Set the property 'build.release' to 'true' if you're generating a release without a time-stamp.
Create release notes if required. Use the format RELEASE-NOTES-<type>-<version>.txt.
All release notes should reside in the 'releasenotes' directory.
The Java app needs to be built by going to 
webapp/java/trunk/ws/apps/webapp and running ant in that directory.

To build all releases, simply type 'ant'.
The releases will be built in the 'nightly' directory.
DO NOT check in the 'nightly' directory into the repository.
However, it is appropriate to check-in new release notes added.

To run RAT on a release, do the following:
. Ensure you have the rat-<version>.jar and commons-lang-<version>.jar
  in ~/.ant/lib.
. Type:  ant php-rat >nightly/php-rat.out
. Type:  ant rails-rat >nightly/rails-rat.out
. Type:  ant java-rat >nightly/java-rat.out

NOTES:
. The running of RAT is not made part of the release generation as it 
  takes a long time.
. TODO: Automate creation of md5 and asc files.
