This is the first release of the rails implementation of Olio.
There are two tarballs for this release: 
apache-olio-rails-0.1.tar.gz is the binary kit.
apache-olio-rails-src-0.1.tar.gz is the source that corresponds to the binary kit.

Please use gtar to extract the contents as there are some very long filenames:
% gzcat apache-olio-rails-0.1.tar.gz | gtar -xvf - 

The instructions for setting up Olio from the binary kit are contained in 
rails_setup_kit.html which is located in the top-level directory.
You can also browse the document at 
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/olio/docs/rails_setup_kit.html

The instructions for setting up Olio from the source kit are contained in
rails_setup.html which is located in the 'docs' directory.
