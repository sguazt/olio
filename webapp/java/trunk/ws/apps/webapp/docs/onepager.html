<h2>BluePrints Social Events Calendar</h2>

This BluePrints application is a social events calendar web 2.0
application and a social networking site. Users can add their own
events, share events,&nbsp;browse events by location including
viewing them on a map, join events, see their friends' events, etc.
Each event would have a details page describing the event, show a small
map of event location, list people who said they were attending, maybe
provide a space for a post-event experience page with photos and
descriptions about the event.This
is also a social networking application focussed on the people, their
identities and expressing themselves, and having a friends network, etc
so has a people page with profile home page, friends network,
list their events. Could be used for specific contexts like all the
JUGS(Java User Groups) events and Tech days events, for example.<br>

  <li>Source code for developers to learn best practices using SWDP and other web technologies.</li>



  <li>Re-useable and clonable for live apps. Provide application
and code that can be re-used by other applications and websites</li>



</ul>
