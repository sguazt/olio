<!-- common-properties.xml: Handling of various properties for the project. 
     This file is not meant to be included directly. 
     This file automatically sets the following properties: 
       build.dir, build.classes.dir
     To change the value of these properties for your project, you need to set them
     BEFORE you include this file. You can do that by defining the property in 
     <user.home>/bpcatalog.properties, build.properties, <root.dir>/build.properties
     or in the build.xml file.
