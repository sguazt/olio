2010-April Olio Incubator status report

Olio has been incubating since September 2008.

Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability, 
functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing 
a reasonably complex application in several different technologies.

Most users are now using the 0.2 release. Except for one issue with the 
Java version, this release seems to be stable.
Several new developers are actively working on the Java version to improve
and expand on it's functionality and robustness.

Olio seems to be the workload of choice for testing virtual machines. Several
researchers as well VMware are using Olio for this purpose.

Graduation From Incubation:

Diversity of committers is the primary issue with the project - 
although we have users, we haven't been successful in converting them to
committers (yet). 

We could use the PMC and Board's help in spreading the word about Olio to get
better traction.
