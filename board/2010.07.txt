2010-July Olio Incubator status report

Olio has been incubating since September 2008.

Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability, 
functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing 
a reasonably complex application in several different technologies.

Most users are now using the 0.2 release. A few bugs have been found in this
release as more users are now using it, but none of them are major. 

We have several new users of Olio this quarter with all 3 versions of the 
application being used. 
Olio seems to be the workload of choice for testing virtual machines. Several
researchers as well VMware are using Olio for this purpose.

Graduation From Incubation:

Diversity of committers is the primary issue with the project - 
although we are adding users, we haven't been successful in converting them to
committers. We have a few users sending patches for bugs they file.

We could use the PMC and Board's help in spreading the word about Olio to get
better traction.
