2010-January Olio Incubator status report

Olio has been incubating since September 2008.

Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability, 
functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing 
a reasonably complex application in several different technologies.

We released Olio 0.2 version on January 13. This release had some major
enhancements to improve performance and better alignment between the
3 versions of the application. This is the first release for the Java version
as well. We have closed a large number of JIRA issues for this release.

Olio is continuing to gain users especially within the academic community
and is being used for diverse purposes from performance testing cloud services 
to specialized file system and databases.
There are 35 subscribers to the user list and 30 subscribers to dev, slightly
more than our Oct report.

Graduation From Incubation:

Diversity of committers is the primary issue with the project - 
although we have users, we haven't been successful in converting them to
committers (yet). 

We could use the PMC and Board's help in spreading the word about Olio to get
better traction.
