2009-October Olio Incubator status report

Olio has been incubating since September 2008.

Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability, 
functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing 
a reasonably complex application in several different technologies.

The developers are working on a second release - 0.2. This release 
features more alignment between the different implementations, performance
enhancements, code cleanup, bug fixes etc.
This will be the first  binary release for the Java implementation.

Even without a kit release, the Java implementation already has several
users. Olio is continuing to gain users and being used for diverse purposes.
There are 30 subscribers to the user list and 26 subscribers to dev.
There are over a hundred JIRA issues filed, and continuous activity
toward closing them.


Graduation From Incubation:

Diversity of committers is the primary issue with the project - we
still need to work on recruiting more committers from different
organizations.
