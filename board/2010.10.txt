2010-October Olio Incubator status report

Olio has been incubating since September 2008.

Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability, 
functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing 
a reasonably complex application in several different technologies.

Things have been fairly quiet on both the user and developer list this quarter.
Olio is being used as part of VMmark2.0 (VMWare's benchmark).

Graduation From Incubation:

Diversity of committers is no longer an issue - we now have committers in 3
organizations. However, ther user base is not showing a strong growth.
Since this is a test application/workload, it is being used as such for 
short-term projects.
